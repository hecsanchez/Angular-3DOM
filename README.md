## Instructions:

The very top blue bar, will be an update bar where we can post messages for updates to the app

The menu is going to be fixed so that is visible when scrolling at all times

There are a lot of expanding sections depending on the amount of content within that section, so this will need to be considered and have a nice solution that won't break the page

There are some of the graphical content that will be needed like:

+ Message number next to icon
+ Darkened menu uption when selected
+ "+" icons to "-" icons when a section is expanded

### Hover CSS:

+ On red buttons with white text, change to blue buttons with white text
+ On white with grey text, change red with white icons to blue with white icons
+ App data list content, highlight the row on hover
+ App data list + and - icons change to red
+ App data list titles - change to red. Blue when selected
+ Any clickable images to have the highlight hover effect
+ Info sections like project groups, history, presentations have a light grey background behind each row on hover
+ Let us know button at footer, change to light blue
+ Any grey icons on a dark background, change to white
+ White icons on grey, change to blue
+ Red icons in white, change to blue

App tools panel icons and hover to be decided when the icons are completed in the next few days

Images - open up in lightbox

### App page
Tools tabs - small icons on the left to control the tab that is viewable

Greyed out if not active

Icon to be bright and coloured if active
